          .p Accurate computing, analysis and modeling of the ventricles and myocardium from 3D medical
            | images is important, especially in the diagnosis and treatment management for patients suffering from 
            | myocardial infarction (MI).
          .p MRI is particularly used to provide imaging anatomical and functional information of heart, such as the
            | T2-weighted CMR which images the acute injury and ischemic regions, and the balanced-Steady State Free
            | Precession (bSSFP) cine sequence which captures cardiac motions and presents clear boundaries.
            | Particularly, LGE CMR can enhance the infarcted myocardium, appearing with distinctive brightness compared
            | with the healthy tissues. It is widely used to study the presence, location, and extent of MI in clinical
            | studies. Thus, delineating ventricles and myocardium from LGE CMR images is important.
          .p However, the segmentation is still arduous, particularly due to the pathological myocardium from LGE CMR;
            | but manual delineation is generally time-consuming, tedious and subject to inter- and intra-observer
            | variations.

          .p This challenge aims at creating an open and fair competition for various research groups to 
            |test and validate their methods, particularly for the multi-sequence ventricle and myocardium segmentation.
          .p We provide 45 multi-sequence CMR images from patients who underwent cardiomyopathy. Each patient had been
            | scanned using the three CMR sequences, i.e. the LGE, T2 and bSSFP. The task of this challenge is to
            | segment the ventricles and myocardium from LGE CMR, combing with other two sequences (T2 and bSSFP) from
            | same patients, which can be used to assist the LGE CMR segmentation. This challenge is not only to
            | benchmark various segmentation algorithms, but also to cover the topic of general cardiac image
            | segmentation, registration and modeling.
